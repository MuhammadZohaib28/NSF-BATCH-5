Question 1: Loops in JavaScript
Write a for loop that iterates through an array of numbers and prints only the even numbers.
Use the following array:

const numbers = [3, 8, 11, 14, 22, 29];







Question 2: IF-ELSE Statement
Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Print the appropriate message for each case.
Assume the number is stored in a variable num.

Example Output:
If num = 5, print "Positive".
If num = -3, print "Negative".
If num = 0, print "Zero".








Question 3: Array of Objects
Given the following array of objects:
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200, inStock: true },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 25, inStock: false },
  { name: "Keyboard", price: 60, inStock: true },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 300, inStock: false }
];

Write a loop that calculates and prints the total price of all products that are in stock.
Expected Output:
Total price of in-stock products: 1260
